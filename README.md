# multimodality
Showcasing coding for python, ATACseq, cellbender and spatial transcriptomics, 

1) **python_scripts**: it contains some python scripts from different projects
	j.ipynb and j.py are from PDAC tropism repository (scripts/Fig_4)
	API.py from EnrichR repository
	mtx2loom.py from veloPipe repository

2) **shell_scripts_pipeline_ATACseq**: it contains bash scripts of ATAC-seq pipeline. These are from the ATACseq repository.

3) **shell_scripts_pipeline_cellbender**: it contains bash scripts of cellbender (denoising snRNAseq data) pipeline

4) **spatial_transcriptomics**: it contains scripts for RCTD-based deconvolution of spatial transcriptome sequencing data in the PDAC tropism project (scripts/Fig_4)
